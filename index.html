			<h2 class="subheader">About Me</h2>

			<p>
				Growth over the past 3 weeks has been significant for me And Iâ€™d like to
				share a story with yall to showcase just that Orginally I came into the
				program with a chip on my shoulder.
			</p>

			<p>
				I told myself that this program was going to be a breeze because I knew
				how to navigate through a computer and understood the basic concepts of
				a programming language.
			</p>

			<p>
				These classes were complex in their own way, and for me, the hardest
				class was called Version control systems class, which is part of the
				quality assurance track here at Year up.
			</p>

			<h3>Ending!</h3>

			<p>
				I didnt know where the beginning was, where the middle was, and
				defnitely didnt know where the end was. On week 2 I decided I needed to
				change my mentality and my daily routine because at this pace, I was not
				going to succeed. I took it upon myself of studying outside of class. In
				the mornings prior to class and a bit in the evenings. I was fully
				involved inn the lectures iPhone off, distractions off, my focus was on
				this class.
